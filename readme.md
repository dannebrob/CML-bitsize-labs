Welcome to my bitsize cml lab repository! This repository contains a collection of small, focused labs designed to help me, and hopefully also you, to learn and practice various concepts in command-line interfaces (CLIs) and related technologies.
Etch topics has its own folder, with subfolders for each lab. Each lab includes a README file with instructions, exercises, and resources to you get started. 
With the goal to mimic realworld scenarios, these labs are designed to be hands-on and practical.

happy Networking!
